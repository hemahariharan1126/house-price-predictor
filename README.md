# House Price Predictor

A practical app where users can check/simulate house price predictions (upload CSV, manual input, see results visually). Great demo for recruiters: real-world tabular data, model evaluation, clear UI.

## Motivation
I kept seeing price prediction in books, but wanted a self-built, sharable app.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask/FastAPI + React or Streamlit
